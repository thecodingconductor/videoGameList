["Video games and music have always gone hand in hand. But what are\u00a0the greatest examples of this marriage?

Most importantly: licensed soundtracks \u2014\u00a0an incredible act of curation and an art form in their own right \u2014 are out of bounds. This means no Beatles Rock Band, no Tony Hawk, and no Grand Theft Auto (for what it\u2019s worth, Vice City is the best) because to mix those with original soundtracks is simply unfair. Also, since video games can have a tremendous amount of sequels we have occasionally chosen our favorite from a series that deserves recognition as a whole. For example, some of us really love Megaman 3, but Megaman 2 is here to take the trophy home for the whole NES team. That way we can include even more games that might have gotten snubbed otherwise (there are, obviously, some exceptional cases).", "Finally, we\u2019ve included a song for each entry and a playlist for them all. But it has to be said, if you really want to get the full experience for these soundtracks give these games a spin. Gaming is a medium that\u2019s meant to be engaged with, and these reactive, organic scores are no different.", "This list brought back a lot of memories, more than your typical retrospective list, and during the very long process of growing it these tunes brought us back to specific times \u2014 Christmas mornings, drunk nights as teenagers, half-forgotten Blockbuster rentals and\u00a0so much more.

Shovel Knight\n Jake Kaufman\n (PC/3DS, 2014)", "Every good 8-bit game needs a good 8-bit soundtrack, and in putting together their NES-era homage Shovel Knight, developers Yacht Club Games knew they had to make sure there was as much attention paid to the sound as there was the rest of the game\u2019s presentation. Thankfully videogame music nerd Jake Kaufman \u2013 who cut his teeth making music for the Game Boy Color in the early \u201800s \u2013 does a bang up job of bringing to mind the golden era of chiptunes. Extra points go to Yacht Club for convincing original Megaman composer Manami Matsumae to contribute two tracks to the score.", "\n99. Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards\n Al Lowe\n (PC, 1987)", "Not as classy as Journey-composer Alex Wintory\u2019s orchestral score for the remake, but we\u2019ll stick with the Roland MT-32 original, which perfectly captures the chintzy trashiness of this Las Vegas vacation (sorry, we mean Lost Wages vacation). When winning means getting the titular 40-year-old virgin laid, classy barely comes into it.", "", "98. Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty\nHarry Gregson-Williams and Norihiko Hibino\n(PS2, 2001)", "a.k.a. one of the only Playstation stealth soundtracks that doesn\u2019t feel horribly dated (we see you hiding at the back, Syphon Filter), a.k.a. the start of your favourite Burial song.", "\n97. Secret of Evermore\n Jeremy Soule and Julian Soule\n (SNES, 1995)", "Oh, the curious case of Secret of Evermore. The only game ever designed by Square in North America, word upon release was that this was a Western spin-off of Secret of Mana (with which it shared many qualities), when Square hadn\u2019t ported the superior Seiken Densetsu 3 (Secret of Mana\u2019s actual sequel) from Japan. That\u2019s been denied by Square, but it didn\u2019t save the game from receiving unfair\u00a0backlash: Evermore is a flawed but good RPG with some genuinely unique elements, one of which is its soundtrack.", "Nothing like other RPG OSTs of the time, it\u2019s the first video game project of Jeremy Soule, who went on to become a titan of the genre, composing the Elder Scrolls series and more. Where the likes of Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy favoured strong, memorable melodies, Evermore\u2019s OST combines long periods of ambience (track titles include \u2018Podunk, 1965\u2019 and \u2018Ambience \u2013 Jungle 2\u2019) with spindly melodies that often feel like they\u2019re held together by Elastoplast. Even some boss battles were simply drum loops and pads. Unfairly maligned, but Soule\u2019s approach to \u201890s RPG music was one of a kind.", "", "96. McDonald\u2019s Treasure Land Adventure\nKatsuhiko Suzuki\n(Genesis, 1993)", "Even when Treasure was doing embarrassing shit like this for money in their early days, that didn\u2019t stop the legendary developer from bringing their all.

Ecco: The Tides Of Time\nAttila Dobos, Andr\u00e1s Magyari, Andy Armer\n(Genesis, 1994)", "The Ecco: The Dolphin series is probably a lot weirder than you remember. What seemed like a cute kids game about a dolphin quickly turned into a very difficult, very trippy adventure that involves aliens, time travel, and the lost city of Atlantis. Ed Annunziata played Pink Floyd for his sound team, and for the Sega CD release of the Tides Of Time hired Spencer Nilson to create an even denser new age score. Go for either one, as the Ecco games make up some of the spaciest music of the era.", "", "94. Twinworld\nHaiko Ruttmann\n(Amiga, 1999)", "A lesser-known gem of the Amiga era, Twinworld is, on the surface, merely a quirky low-budget fantasy platformer. Thanks to a gorgeous, textured score from German composer Haiko Ruttmann (who is better known for his work on the more fondly-remembered The Settlers) however, Twinworld punches way above its weight, even now.", "", "93. System Shock 2\nEric Brosius, Ramin Djawadi, Josh Randall\n(PC, 1999)", "System Shock 2\u2019s blend of shooting and role-playing elements made it a game years ahead of its time, but it was the feeling that there could be untold horrors lurking around every corner of its starship setting that really elevated the game above the Quake clones of the time. Though it was a game filled with alien terrors signalled by nerve-shredding moments of musical tension, the game was as much about the fear of technology, and the foreboding digital textures and futuristic techno created by Eric Brosius, Ramin Djawadi and Josh Randall made it one of the best cyberpunk-inspired scores in any medium.", "", "92.

Ikaruga\nHiroshi Iuchi\n(Dreamcast, 2001)", "If you don\u2019t remember the music from Ikaruga, it\u2019s probably because you were too busy getting killed, repeatedly and unceremoniously.

There\u2019s too many trumpets, too many hoedowns, and too much of the sort of rinky-dinky playground music that tires even quicker than the Wing Cap\u2019s controls, but it deserves inclusion for a few spectacular moments \u2013 namely the brilliant \u2018Inside the Castle Walls\u2019, and the water theme used on Dire, Dire Docks, Jolly Roger Bay and the Secret Aquarium, a.k.a.

Dragon Quest VIII\nKoichi Sugiyama\n(PS2, 2004)", "Much like the game, there\u2019s nothing quite as memorable as the stand-out themes of Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger et al on this OST, but by god when it\u2019s good it\u2019s about as high-grade and beautiful as this whole damn world gets.", "", "88. VVVVVV\nMagnus P\u00e5lsson\n(PC, 2010)", "Released in 2010, VVVVVV is based on bizarre early platformer Jet Set Willy, a game so confounding and so difficult that its haunting, chiming 8-bit themes still strike fear into the hearts of 30-somethings. Understandably, the score was going to be equally important to Terry Cavanagh\u2019s homage, so chiptune composer Magnus P\u00e5lsson put together a series of themes so addictive that they almost offset the controller-throwing frustration of the game itself. Almost.", "", "87. Psychonauts\nPeter McConnell\n(Xbox, 2005)", "Rather than sticking with one blend of tones, Psychonauts found director Tim Schafer and the Double Fine crew shifting from one to another as his psychic hero Raz explored different minds. The result is a genre hopping carnival ride and one of Peter McConnell\u2019s wildest scores. Whatever fractured mind you enter McConnell finds a way to make the music stick. How to write music for a conspiracy-filled 1950s world, a town of terrified lungfish running from your Kaiju-sized hero, and a black velvet bull fighting world must be hard enough. Tying it all into one game is a job only McConnell could have accomplished.", "", "86. Megaman X\nSetsuo Yamamoto, Makoto Tomozawa, Yuki Iwai, Yuko Takehara, Toshihiko Horiyama\n(SNES, 1993)", "Let\u2019s face it, Megaman already had a fool-proof concept (so fool-proof that they wheeled it out for 20-odd games, and that\u2019s not including Megaman Legends, Megaman Soccer and the rest of the spin-offs) and the best melodies in the 8-bit market. All they really needed to do to make up the step up to SNES work was to make everything bigger, and so we got Megaman X, a game that basically just took Megaman 2 to the IMAX and little more. And that\u2019s fine: Capcom are pretty much the kings of if it ain\u2019t broke don\u2019t fix it, Megaman X was another classic, and Storm Eagle, Boomer Kuwanger and Chill Penguin\u2019s themes sit comfortably in amongst 8-bit classics like Elec Man, Snake Man and Bubble Man.", "", "85. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney\nMasakazu Sugimori and Naoto Tanaka\n(Game Boy Advance, 2001)", "Who knows what gave this pair the idea to score wordy courtroom drama with the kind of pulsing, action-packed soundtrack more appropriate for, well, any other Capcom game, but we\u2019re glad they did. Sugimori and Tanaka make saving a defendant with truth and logic sound more badass than killing someone with your fists \u2014 which of course it is.", "", "84. The Binding of Isaac\nDanny Baranowsky\n(PC, 2011)", "Don\u2019t let the drawing fool you \u2013\u00a0The Binding of Isaac\u00a0is almost certainly the darkest game on this 100, with a soundtrack more chilling than any zombie horror.", "", "83.

All the soundtracks are worth revisiting, but Police Quest III gets a special mention because somehow Sierra managed to convince Miami Vice composer Jan Hammer to offer up a score. Hearing Hammer\u2019s unmistakable cues hobbled by the endearing limitations of a primitive soundcard is a rare treat.", "", "82. Skies of Arcadia\nYutaka Minobe and Tatsuyuki Maeda\n(Dreamcast, 2000)", "Compromised after it was condensed to the more popular single-disc Gamecube reissue, Skies Of Arcadia\u2019s score shines on the double-disc Dreamcast original. Sega realized that the most satisfying part of any RPG was getting the airship, so they made an entire game set in a swashbuckling sky world. The sense of adventure was only increased by Minobe and Sonic 3 & Knuckles composer Tatsuyuki Maeda\u2019s exciting themes which avoided the pitfalls of making just another weighty RPG score. True to the game, this one soars.", "", "81. Altered Beast\nTohru Nakabayashi\n(Arcade, 1988)", "\u201cWELCOME TO YOUR DOOM.\u201d", "They just don\u2019t make \u2019em like this anymore, for real.

Bomberman Hero\nJun Chikuma\n(N64, 1998)", "As an entry into the franchise, Bomberman Hero is borderline blasphemous: it\u2019s a platformer instead of a puzzler, with no multiplayer in sight. There was just one reason to play it \u2013 the soundtrack; it clearly belongs in a better game.", "Don\u2019t let \u2018Redial\u2019 fool you: for such a peppy and cherry game (about throwing bombs) this is a serious listen, the majority of its tunes splicing acid and drum\u2019n\u2019bass together in a way that would make pirate radio lose its shit.", "", "79. Kentucky Route Zero\nBen Babbitt\n(PC, 2013)", "On the surface, Kentucky Route Zero is a contemporary point-and-click adventure, but underneath it\u2019s much more than that. A surreal tale in which a character called Conway attempts to deliver a parcel from the antiques company he works for through beautifully drawn but bleak locations and a number of odd encounters, it\u2019s a game that captures that feeling of driving along an empty road in a remote location in the dead of night. Ben Babbitt\u2019s score paints that feeling not as something to fear, but as something comforting.", "", "78. Panzer Dragoon\nYoshitaka Azuma\n(Saturn, 1995)", "An oft-overlooked rail shooter for the Saturn, Panzer Dragoon may have been trumped by the N64\u2019s Lylat Wars in gameplay, but it made up for it with its soundtrack, which often simply shimmered for three or four minutes before kicking in to add new levels of tension to a stage\u2019s second half. Oh, and you didn\u2019t have to put up with Slippy the Toad, either.", "", "77. DuckTales\nHiroshige Tonomura\n(NES, 1989)", "DuckTales could have gotten away with just an 8-bit repetition of the show\u2019s admittedly awesome theme song and we\u2019d have been happy. Instead Sakaguchi gave us some of the most charismatic melodies on the NES with \u2018Amazon\u2019 and the staccato strikes of \u2018Transylvania\u2019. \u2018The Moon\u2019, meanwhile, is one of the greatest moments in 8-bit music and proof that even a few bleeps and bloops can be beautiful.", "", "76. Super Mario RPG\nYoko Shimomura\n(SNES, 1996)", "You\u2019ll be seeing Yoko Shimomura again. By Squaresoft\u2019s 1996 SNES swan song (at least for the English speaking lot), she was ready to show off everything she had mastered over the 16-bit era, making a self-aware, enthusiastic score that calls back melodies from every Mario game before it, and adds impossibly catchy numbers by the dozens from all her years jump-starting beat-em-ups, and maybe a tearjerker here and there. Yoko Shimomura is never the first name that crops up when you\u2019re talking about the greatest composers in her field, but this is Exhibit A for why she should be.", "Shout out to Geno and Mallow, too.", "", "75. The Curse of Monkey Island\nMichael Land\n(PC, 1997)", "It\u2019s hard to explain exactly how influential LucasArts\u2019 Monkey Island games were. Aside from having copy protection that forced budding young (software) pirates to commandeer a photocopier, a pair of scissors and a split pin, the series featured a\u00a0level of humor that distracted you from the game\u2019s technical limitations. Whilst a slew of fight scenes might have been difficult for Lucasarts to achieve, brawling with one-liners with was a creative and effective replacement.", "Michael Land\u2019s score needed to reflect the game\u2019s absurdist humor, and on Monkey Island\u2019s third installment, Land turned in his finest work to date. The Curse of Monkey Island allowed Land to expand his already-beloved set of themes into lavish, widescreen masterpieces, and they never sounded better \u2013 the steel-drum laced rendition of the title theme could make even the hardest-faced cynic break into a smile.", "", "74. Time Crisis\nKazuhiro Nakamura\n(Arcade, 1996)", "Take away the hokey plot about an attempted coup in a fictional republic and Namco\u2019s classic arcade rail shooter was little more than a static series of shooting galleries, but the relentless urgency of Kazuhiro Nakamura\u2019s score made shooting generic bad guys with a plastic replica firearm feel like your own personal action movie. In the current age of multi-million dollar Call Of Duty sequels it\u2019s commonplace for gunfire and cover-dodging to be drowned out by a sweeping orchestral score, but Time Crisis did it first, and it still gets the pulse racing like nothing else.", "", "73. Oddworld: Abe\u2019s Odyssee\nEllen Meijers-Gabriel and Josh Gabriel\n(PSX, 1997)", "You play as a hug-able abomination rescuing your abominable friends from the evil Overlords of Abomination. Take away the game and you listen in awe of what has to be an Amon Tobin record that never saw the light of day (it isn\u2019t, but you can fool people).", "", "72. Bastion\nDarren Korb\n(360, 2011)", "Innovative indie game Bastion was praised on release for its originality in the face of a world crowded by sequels and remakes, and Darren Korb\u2019s soundtrack certainly helped its case. Combining Ry Cooder-esque frontier bluegrass with electronic elements, Korb nails the game\u2019s bizarre retro-future setting, adding a crucial layer to the game\u2019s dense (and surprisingly cinematic) assault of audiovisual elements.", "", "71. Gitaroo Man\nCOIL\n(PS2, 2001)", "A rhythm game needs good music first and foremost, and it\u2019s COIL\u2019s (not that Coil) insane sci-fi rock opera which elevated Gitaroo Man to genre masterpiece. The band emulate the changing musical styles of each villain which includes a cosmic space shark with turntables for a chest. If you thought Scott Pilgrim\u2019s music battles were too cool to be original, well they weren\u2019t \u2014 get some Gitaroo in your life.", "", "70. Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon\nPower Glove\n(PS3/360, 2013)", "Part Saturday morning kids cartoon, part shameless parody of pretty much every 80s action film from Rambo to Robocop, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is a game that revels in its pop culture references and retro type of violence. A game like that needs a special kind of score, and Australian duo Power Glove (whose name comes from a notoriously bad NES peripheral) more than delivered with a score\u00a0that resisted the temptation to mine the era\u2019s 8-bit themes for inspiration and instead delivered gleefully kitsch send up of the era\u2019s action movie soundtracks.", "", "69. Crash Bandicoot\nJosh Mancell\n(PSX, 1996)", "One of the Playstation\u2019s early success stories,\u00a0Crash Bandicoot may have had its fair share of\u00a0hidden levels, but its real secret? Its soundtrack has the best Funky house riffs this side of Crazy Cousins. Show Jamie xx the door \u2013 this is where the real steel drum action lies.", "", "68. The Neverhood\nTerry Scott Taylor\n(PC, 1996)", "Given free creative reign and armed with an acoustic guitar, a full studio of tricks, and some of the most charmingly odd \u201cmouth sounds\u201d you\u2019ll ever hear, Terry Scott Taylor provided a soundtrack as bizarre, silly, and rich as Earthworm Jim-creator Doug TeNapel\u2019s claymation universe of The Neverhood. \u2018Everybody Way Oh\u2019 is the best song Ween never wrote, \u2018Olley Oxen Free\u2019 is a public service for the world of yodeling.", "", "67. Halo: Combat Evolved\nMartin O\u2019Donnell and Michael Salvatori\n(Xbox, 2001)", "As the game that launched Microsoft\u2019s Xbox, Halo needed to be a blockbuster in every sense of the word, and Martin O\u2019Donnell and Michael Salvatori\u2019s score matched the game\u2019s vast scale with a truly epic score. Its Gregorian chanting may have dated a little in the years since, but at the time it showed that it wasn\u2019t just JRPGs that could deliver complex orchestral scores capable of drawing emotion out of a sci-fi setting. Given how popular the series has become, the Halo theme is probably now as widely recognised as Super Mario Bros\u2019\u00a0and deservedly so \u2013 it heralded a era of more cinematic gaming whose influence is still being felt today.", "", "66. Out Run\nHiroshi Kawaguchi\n(Arcade, 1986)", "Admit it, very little from 1986 sounds like the future anymore. Maybe PiL, maybe Sade, or maybe even Out Run. Out Run more or less predicted the sound of the Genesis, which was still three years away, and there\u2019s now a half-decade\u2019s worth of chillwave and synth pop that sounds like the producers were raised waiting in line to play this game in\u00a0the arcade. At least that\u2019s how we like to see it.", "", "65. Ys I & II\nYuzo Koshiro and Mieko Ishikawa\n(PCE, 1989)", "Massively popular in Japan, the Ys series never really took off in the West in the same way as, say, Final Fantasy, but it shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. The first two games were bundled together for the US market on the short-lived PC Engine/TurboGrafx console, and while the console itself has been mostly forgotten, the games themselves (and the excellent soundtracks) are among the best of their era. Because the PC Engine version used CD, Japanese composer Ryo Yonemitsu was given the all-clear to remix the scores in high quality for the North American release. Even if you\u2019ve never come across Ys before, it shouldn\u2019t be ignored.", "", "64. Battletoads\nDavid Wise\n(NES, 1991)", "Battletoads is out for blood from the second you hit \u201cstart,\u201d and so was David Wise, the secret weapon of the 8-bit era who finally got the chance to sprawl out and get some dirt on his hands after making memorable tunes for many of the NES\u2019 worst cash-ins (Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Nightmare on Elm Street, fucking Hollywood Squares) and its guilty pleasures (RC Pro Am, Marble Madness). Even if no one can actually admit to beating Battletoads, Wise made it a blast to break your controller to again and again, while also crafting the greatest pause screen music ever made.", "", "63. Bubble Bobble\nTadashi Kimijima\n(Arcade, 1986)", "There\u2019s not a lot of music in Bubble Bobble, but what\u2019s there has been a constant throughout decades of gaming. The game appeared in arcades back in 1986, before being ported to pretty much any system that could handle it, and so the legend began. The series gave birth to Rainbow Islands, Parasol Stars, Puzzle Bobble/Bust-a-Move and countless sequels, and anchoring the whole thing was a simple melody that stands as one of the greatest themes of the arcade generation. It\u2019s cute and undeniably catchy, and even after hearing it for hours and hours in a one snack-fuelled session at a time, we still love it \u2013 now that\u2019s an achievement.", "", "62. Gone Home\nChris Remo\n(PC, 2013)", "You\u2019re home from studying abroad. Your parents and sister are gone. A scrawled note from your sister says she loves you, don\u2019t look for her. The power is out, there\u2019s a storm. That\u2019s all you get from Gone Home, a horror game of sorts built on the simple fear that the people you love aren\u2019t there and you don\u2019t know why. Remo\u2019s score feeds on every present fear and anxiety, while receding into somber, sweet memories with each coming-of-age diary entry voiceover until you finally learn the fate of your sister. When it finally reaches the closing pair of \u2018In The Attic\u2019 and \u2018I Said Yes\u2019 there won\u2019t be a dry eye in the house.", "", "61. Golden Axe\nTohru Nakabayashi and You Takada\n(Arcade, 1989)", "Golden Axe was envisioned as a collision of the fantasy elements that made up the popular console hit Dragon Quest and the side-scrolling (and quarter-eating) beat-em-up qualities of arcade brawler Double Dragon. The result was one of the most memorable games of its era, and it had a score to match. Ignore the more recent orchestral remake \u2013 Tohru Nakabayashi and You Takada\u2019s ominous, pulsing electronics never needed real-world embellishment. It managed to be majestic, evocative and memorable using precious few elements: just listen to the terrifying \u2018Death Adder\u2019 theme and tell us you aren\u2019t feeling your pockets get lighter with each blast.", "", "60. Dune II\nPaul Mudra, Frank Klepacki, Dwight Okahara\n(PC, 1992)", "Before the world-beating Command & Conquer series, before Korean academies prepped groups of kids for Starcraft tournaments, there was Dune II. The pseudo-sequel to the enjoyable but forgettable Dune, which appeared on PC and (ahem) Sega Mega CD in the early \u201890s, Dune II stepped everything up by removing the adventure elements to concentrate more solidly on Real Time Strategy. This was a game that demanded patience from its players \u2013 it was basically Civilization in Frank Herbert\u2019s universe \u2013 and the soundtrack was a crucial part of the enjoyment. One part Radiophonic Workshop shimmer and one part demoscene hyperactivity, it\u2019s aged surprisingly well, and still sounds just as gloomy and cinematic now as it did back in 1993.", "", "59. Star Fox\nHajime Hirasawa\n(SNES, 1993)", "Let\u2019s talk about Slippy the Toad for a second, that dainty, incompetent engineer that somehow landed a prime spot in the Lylat System\u2019s top mercenary squad. With each game he manages to get worse at his job.", "In the original Star Fox, he pulls his weight, but we\u2019re not sure how exactly. The music must\u2019ve had something do with it. Star Fox itself is still a blast to play despite looking like a tech demo, but its score is on another level. It\u2019s grand, seemlessly combining trademark SNES bangers with orchestral punches to the face, and there\u2019s very little that\u2019ll get shit done faster than \u2018Corneria\u2019, \u2018Sector X\u2019, and \u2018Space Armada\u2019. Better music makes better squadmates.", "", "58. Fez\nRich Vreeland (Disasterpeace)\n(360, 2012)", "When the \u201cchiptune\u201d movement started, plenty of producers were making retro songs that would\u2019ve been perfect on a NES. Rich Vreeland aka Disasterpiece bent and broke the rules of that sound for Fez. Vreeland\u2019s music took its sweet, beautiful time, creating settings that wavered between ominous and curious. This is still his best stand alone work, but it\u2019s no surprise that someone caught on to the game eventually and hired Vreeland to score recent horror masterpiece It Follows.", "", "57. It Came From the Desert\nKen Melville\n(Amiga, 1989)", "Taking inspiration from \u201850s sci-fi B movie Them! (in which giant mutant ants invade Los Angeles), It Came From the Desert exhibited a refreshingly slow pace, which only highlighted the game\u2019s memorable creeping terror. The original Amiga version\u2019s the one (the addition of FMV sequences on later versions actually managed to ruin the game, somehow), and Ken Melville\u2019s dusty John Carpenter-esque soundtrack adds the required eerie tone, his shockingly limited palate only adding to the atmosphere.", "", "56. Legend of the Mystical Ninja\nKazuhiko Uehara and Harumi Ueko\n(SNES, 1991)", "A massively underrated soundtrack to a massively underrated (if ridiculously hard, in its second half) game, the charm of Mystical Ninja\u2019s OST lies less in its action moments and more in its motel, massage parlour, town and game show themes (several of which, we should add, did the whole *boink!* thing long before Craig David).

Yep, you read that right \u2013 Nine Inch Nails\u2019 Trent Reznor was tapped to provide the ominous musical accompaniment, and it made total sense. This was around the same time as Reznor had assisted David Lynch in putting together the music for Lost Highway and there\u2019s a sense that Reznor was trying to prove himself as someone more than just the guy from Nine Inch Nails.

The game itself is undoubtedly one of its generation\u2019s most beloved titles, and deservedly so \u2013 immersing yourself in Bethesda\u2019s pitch-perfect world is a rare pleasure, and the music serves to remind the player of exactly what\u2019s been lost. We recognize the music, but most of us weren\u2019t there; it already sounds haunting, and that puts us in the mindset of the lonely vault hunter, traipsing across a nuclear wasteland in search of hope.

Koshiro is quite rightly on this list a number of times, and his Revenge of Shinobi score is so beloved that it\u2019s been performed by an orchestra a number of times in the last decade.

Despite a galaxy-spanning sci-fi setting whose adventure elements foreshadowed Mass Effect by a good 15 years, much of Star Control II\u2019s soundtrack sounds like a lost 80s treasure trove of unreleased techno, synth pop and Italo that matches a lot of similar stuff being discovered on duty DAT tapes.

Each of the game\u2019s themes were iconic in their own right \u2013 especially the showstopping efforts for Ryu and Guile\u2019s stages \u2013 but it was the tongue-in-cheek tone each theme adopted that made them all so memorable. In a recent interview, composer Yoko Shimamura explained that she intended each to have the \u201cfeeling of each country\u201d rather than create accurate representations of the fighters\u2019 home nations, and the result is a unique musical representation of the globe seen heard through Japanese ears.

The world of Half-Life 2 is a hostile one, expecting you to piece together the events that led to the near annihilation of humanity at the hands of an extra-dimensional alien force, and Bailey\u2019s score is the perfect accompaniment to the a world of alienation and confusion that sticks with you long after the G Man has adjusted his tie.", "", "31. Final Fantasy 7\nNobuo Uematsu\n(PSX, 1997)", "The biggest RPG in history needed \u2013 and received \u2013 a soundtrack to match.

As a listening experience, it\u2019s masterfully paced, a true exercise in attack and release. In the game, it\u2019s sublime, and that\u2019s when worlds fail all over again.", "", "17. Jet Set Radio\nHideki Naganuma\n(Dreamcast, 2000)", "Jet Set Radio looked like a comic book and played like a cross between Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skateboarder and a graffiti simulator. To this day there hasn\u2019t been a game quite like it, and the same goes for the soundtrack, which fused \u201890s big beat, J-pop and hip hop into a collection of day-glo instrumentals that are probably the closest you\u2019ll get to taking an LSD trip inside a Dreamcast. International versions of the game featured licensed tracks from the likes of Jurassic 5 and Rob Zombie, but they\u2019re totally unnecessary \u2013 Hideka Naganuma\u2019s originals are some of the most wonderfully anarchic video game themes to ever have come out of Japan.", "", "16. Final Fantasy VI\nNobuo Uematsu\n(SNES, 1994)", "We\u2019ll probably wind up in debates over what the best Final Fantasy is until the end of time, but let\u2019s be real about this: as a score, this is Nobuo Uematsu\u2019s magnum opus, a masterful tapestry of nearly flawless tracks spread over three compact discs, a first of its kind for any soundtrack.", "Uematsu was already unstoppable by 1994, but the second the franchise traded medieval times and swords for steampunk and gunpowder, Uematsu entered the gaming lexicon permanently. 21 years later, we still get chills the first time we see Kefka\u2019s true colors, or when the curtain rises on the opera scene, then when everything goes kaboom.", "", "15. Earthbound\nKeiichi Suzuki, Hirokazu Tanaka, Hiroshi Kanazu, Toshiyuki Ueno\n(SNES, 1994)", "Earthbound (and the Mother series, period) is so far off in its own little strange world that to get into exactly why it\u2019s so good, you\u2019d have to give its final hours away. Therein lies the appeal of Earthbound, and why so many swear by it: it\u2019s not one off-kilter piece or several, it\u2019s all of them adding up. The surprises never stop coming.", "Earthbound\u2018s soundtrack is probably the\u00a0largest on this list, at over 150 tracks. It\u2019s the most brilliantly creative score on the Super Nintendo, and the music alone takes up a third of the cart space. It\u2019s an all-star team of Nintendo vets (\u201cHip\u201d Tanaka), film composers (Keiichi Suzuki), and even a refugee from Yellow Magic Orchestra. And it goes everywhere; an argument could even be made that it pioneered the creative use of sampling in video games. What other game can throw so many things at you and still remind you to call mom when you\u2019re homesick?", "", "14. Secret of Mana\nHiroki Kikuta\n(SNES, 1993)", "Hiroki Kikuta\u2019s first video game score and his best. One of the first RPG scores to use samples rather than just MIDI, Secret of Mana\u2019s OST set the bar for both Square and SNES soundtracks, and although it was arguably bettered by the later Chrono Trigger and Earthbound, tell us there\u2019s a better 16-bit RPG opening theme than \u2018Fear of the Heavens\u2019 and we\u2019ll call you a liar.", "", "13. Resident Evil 4\nMisao Senbongi and Shusaku Uchiyama\n(GameCube, 1995)", "The sense of pure relief when Resident Evil 4\u2019s blissful, serene save game music bubbles through the speakers is hard to overstate. Capcom\u2019s influential survival horror series was always blessed with great in-game music, but Misao Senbongi and Shusaku Uchiyama struck gold with their cues for the fourth (and best) installment of the saga. Moody and evocative, the soundtrack not only helped to emphasize the game\u2019s creeping dread and heighten the action but introduced plenty of young players to the idea of synth-laced ambience. You don\u2019t have to travel too far on SoundCloud before hearing a sample buried beneath some kind of glitchy 2-step beat or other.", "", "12. Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy\u2019s Kong Quest\nDavid Wise\n(SNES, 1995)", "Before the gameplay proved Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy Kong\u2019s Quest to be a seemingly impossible improvement over the original \u2014 the Godfather II of platform games, if you will, David Wise\u2019s \u2018K. Rool Returns\u2019 made it crystal clear. Those haunting strings blended with triumphant horns said it all: this was a game that would be more exciting and terrifying that you could handle. Add into that some of the most luscious ambient pieces of the decade with \u2018Forest Interlude\u2019 and \u2018Stickerbrush Symphony\u2019 (a piece that \u2014 by his own admission \u2014 has inspired Ryan Hemsworth\u2019s entire career) and you have the magnum opus from one of the medium\u2019s greatest auteurs.", "", "11. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\nKoji Kondo\n(N64, 1998)", "The first Zelda game to go 3D, housed in what was then the N64\u2019s largest capacity cartridge, Ocarina of Time was the last Zelda OST that Koji Kondo worked on solo. It\u2019s also the series\u2019 best.", "Without a single version of the original Zelda theme included (how the nerds revolted!), Koji took advantage of the N64\u2019s capabilities to expand upon and better Link to the Past in every way. A big part of what makes the game\u2019s OST so successful is the way that it incorporates its music into the story and gameplay (the clue\u2019s in the title), but even taken alone the soundtrack is a stunner: the breezy-but-longing town and forest themes (\u2018Kakariko Village\u2019, \u2018Lon Lon Ranch\u2019, \u2018Lost Woods\u2019) are classics, the dungeons (\u2018Dodongo\u2019s Cavern\u2019, \u2018Shadow Temple\u2019, \u2018Spirit Temple\u2019) nod to the bleak solitude of Super Metroid, and alongside\u00a0Mario 64\u2019s water theme, it makes a great case for the N64 as the New Ager\u2019s console of choice with \u2018Inside the Deku Tree\u2019, \u2018Zora\u2019s Domain\u2019 and the \u2018Forest Temple\u2019. Like the first time you enter the 64-bit Hyrule Fiend, Ocarina\u2019s OST feels vast, free and full of possibility.", "", "10. Red Dead Redemption\nBill Elm and Woody Jackson\n(PS3/360, 2010)", "Video gaming is so often concerned with play, it\u2019s rare that we\u2019re given the opportunity just to take a few minutes to take in the view. Red Dead Redemption\u2019s brutal frontier setting and Bill Elm and Woody Jackson\u2019s spaghetti western-inspired score offered plenty of moments to soak in the scenery, whether you were chasing a steam locomotive or watching the sun rise over the desert. However, it was the ride into Mexico soundtracked by Jose Gonzalez\u2019s \u2018Far Away\u2019 that stuck in the mind long after the game had concluded, a moment that showed video games could allow you to choreograph your own cinematic moments just as capably as anything you\u2019d see on the big screen.", "", "9. Portal\nKelly Bailey and Mike Morasky\n(PC, 2007)", "When people think about the music of Portal they\u2019ll always remember Jonathan Coulton\u2019s tongue-in-cheek acoustic number \u2018Still Alive\u2019, and for good reason \u2013 nothing else has nailed musical humour in video games quite like it. However, Kelly Bailey\u2019s stellar score is just as important at bringing the sterile test chambers of Aperture Science to life, reflecting its numbing corporate training video atmosphere through a simmering series of claustrophobic ambient tracks and fast-paced escape themes. Portal is a funny game, but it\u2019s also a chilling one \u2013 not even in survival horror has a score created such unease so effortlessly.", "", "8. Streets Of Rage 2\nYuzo Koshiro and Motohiro Kawashima\n(Genesis, 1992)", "Back in the days of the \u201cconsole wars\u201d Sega, initially the underdog (especially in the USA), managed to position themselves as slightly edgier than their massive, world-beating competitors Nintendo. Nintendo\u2019s consoles were seen as kid\u2019s toys (a badge they\u2019re still struggling to shake), Sega\u2019s Genesis on the other hand was edgy and somewhat adult, mostly thanks to titles like Streets of Rage, a violent side-scrolling beat-em-up that Nintendo would have never let tarnish their family-friendly image.", "The game\u2019s soundtrack was similarly \u201cmature,\u201d and unlike family-friendly fare like Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Mario World, chirpy melodies were nowhere to be seen. Instead players were treated to techno and breakbeat-influenced compositions from Yuzo Koshiro, bringing an unusual club swagger to the game. Saying this was influential barely even begins to cover it \u2013 Ikonika, Joker and Just Blaze have all talked openly about Streets of Rage 2\u2019s towering score, countless others no doubt subliminally headed towards electronic music thanks to Koshiro\u2019s guiding hand.", "", "7. Katamari Damacy\nYuu Miyake, Asuka Sakai, Akitaka Tohyama, Hideki Tobeta, Yoshihito Yano, Yuri Misumi\n(PS2, 2004)", "While trying to pick out a song (borderline impossible) to represent the score to rolling up caramels and people so your hungover father (and his pants) can rebuild the starry sky, a thought occurred. Katamari Damacy is one of the weirdest, catchiest, and flat-out astonishing pop records of the last decade, never repeating itself and always maintaining a god-level tier in terms of production. And it will age perfectly. This music is universally loved by everyone. And here\u2019s where it gets fun: look at every top list of music from the decade and you\u2019ll realize there\u2019s a gaping hole where this record should be.", "", "6. Silent Hill\nAkira Yamaoka\n(PSX, 1999)", "Survival horror was already a successful sub-genre by the time Silent Hill shuffled onto shelves in 1999. Resident Evil and its worthy sequel had been huge hits, and Playstation gamers were primed for what was to be one of the platform\u2019s most defining games. What set Silent Hill apart from its peers wasn\u2019t just the terrifying slow pace of the gameplay, it was the evocative suite of Lynchian experimental music and the immersive collection of sound effects.", "We can thank Akira Yamoaka for both; Yamoaka asked to be handed the reigns after the original composer quit, and as a fan of British electro pop (Ultravox, Visage) and German industrial music (Nitzer Ebb) he was eager to push things in a more industrial electronic direction. Initially, on playing his work for the rest of the team, they assumed it was a game bug \u2013 in fact the dread-filled waves of white noise would come to characterize the game.", "Ingeniously, Silent Hill\u2019s key in-game device for tracking its sparse and often horrifying antagonists (dead children, deformed nurses \u2013 you know) was a small radio which would pick up more and more static the closer the enemies became. Combined with the nauseous, wavering FM synth sounds, the result was doom-inducing enough to cement the game in the minds of thousands of young players. In 2015 it\u2019s commonplace for games (especially horror games) to mine the rich seam of experimental ambient music, and we can probably thank Akira Yamoaka for that.", "", "5. Super Metroid\nKenji Yamamoto and Minako Hamano\n(SNES, 1994)", "Like the constantly evolving parasite itself, Super Metroid put the original through a complete metamorphosis. From its opening drones it sounded even more alienating than Metroid\u2018s score, but then from that darkness emerged something only people who survived to the end of the original heard: a small, heroic melody. It\u2019s a completely backwards move, but then again everything about Super Metroid seemed backwards.", "After a short intro, you were guiding Samus Aran back down the same tunnel she escaped from at the end of the original to rescue a metroid? But there\u2019s that main melody, that reassurance to protect rather than destroy. It set up one of the most emotional gaming stories of all time without a single line of dialogue. With no one other humans to speak to, Samus\u2019 thoughts and emotions were evoked entirely through Super Metroid\u2019s score. The miasmatic drones in Crateria capture the eye stinging discovery that nature reclaimed these familiar places (a clear influence on The Last Of Us), we feel the stupefying terror in the desperate boss battles because we hear it in the gasping, shrieking music. Much later during the watery themes in the mysterious sunken world of Maridia we can almost feel Samus thinking with us, \u201cWhat was this place? What happened here?\u201d", "And finally, during the last hopeless moments against Mother Brain, as we watched the metroid we were trying to save get killed before our eyes and Samus become filled with an unstoppable parental rage, what returned? That same small melody we heard at the beginning, now without the series\u2019 iconic chilling tones it sounds clearer. It was stronger, braver, more complete. And so were we.", "", "4. Megaman 2\nTakashi Tateishi\n(NES, 1988)", "Tunes from the NES will always endure for one reason: their simplicity. This was back when games were just that. You played and hopefully won. Social commentary? Engrossing narratives and ambiguous characters? Not even on the radar yet. All you did with the Blue Bomber in Megaman 2 was run, jump, point, and shoot until Dr. Wiley\u2019s army was scrap.", "In other words, it was just pure fun and the bare essentials before we knew what was coming, and all that was needed to complete the package was a bulletproof roster of incredible tunes to keep you going after Heat Man\u2019s stage kills you again and again. You memorized the songs, then memorized the stages. Each theme is so good that figuring out the best song from the game requires multiple coin flips. Megaman 2 is the best soundtrack the NES ever produced, and the poster child for why simple songs on the 8-bit machine keep inspiring things like this.", "", "3. The Last Of Us\nGustavo Santaolalla\n(PS3, 2013)", "The Last Of Us might be a post-apocalyptic zombie tale on the surface, but at its heart is the tale of a bond that grows between an orphaned girl and the father who lost his daughter several years previously. The game\u2019s tone is closer to The Road than Resident Evil, and 21 Grams and Brokeback Mountain composer Gustavo Santaolalla lends the game\u2019s score the emotional heft it needs. The Last Of Us is rightly hailed as a landmark moment in video game storytelling, writing and acting, but Santaolalla\u2019s reflective score is equally as important, showing that a little more musical subtlety in blockbuster games might not be such a bad idea.", "", "2. Chrono Trigger\nYasunori Mitsuda, Nobuo Uematsu, Noriko Matsueda\n(SNES, 1995)", "For a game that spans over 65,000,000 years and is often considered the best RPG in history, Chrono Trigger is oddly understated. Released between the two titans of the Final Fantasy series, this weird hybrid of Secret of Mana and Day of the Tentacle where your final party includes a robot, a frog and a cavegirl has, for many, come out on top of Square\u2019s golden period, and its soundtrack may be the most quietly influential (at least in FACT\u2019s world) of all of the company\u2019s RPGs.", "Way ahead of its time in terms of its approach and influences, you could even file it as hypnagogic, with Mitsuda claiming that he drew on specific dreams for certain tracks, and Vangelis is a clear reference point (there\u2019s even a track called \u2018Memories of Green\u2019). It\u2019s sometimes tough to go a day without hearing a track that shares DNA with \u2018Corridors of Time\u2019, and Ryan Hemsworth, Murlo and Groundislava are just a handful of the modern producers inspired by it. Don\u2019t even get us started on Chrono Jigga.", "", "1. Ico\nMichiru Oshima, Koichi Yamazaki, Mitsukuni Murayama\n(PS2, 2001)", "For all the hyperactive electronics and epic sweeping scores we come to an end here with Ico, a video game almost designed to make you feel small and powerless. Following Ico and Yorda, two intended child-sacrifices, wandering through ancient ruins searching for escape we learned to cherish the moments of peace and quiet reflection over any action packed peak. Through his profoundly organic soundtrack Oshima used perpetually circling motifs, both terrifying and relaxing (or both, in the case of the pensive \u2018Castle In The Mist\u2019), to show a cycle of abuse only just breaking. It\u2019s a game about finding strength in friendship. It\u2019s a game about holding hands.", "More than any medium, the soundtrack to a video game needs to be reactive and it\u2019s something that Ico masters. Take for instance the brief fever dream of \u2018Who Are You\u2019, which shimmers in foggy melody as we discover our companion, before the bottom drops out into an ocean of dark ambience. That sinking horror signals shadowy beings determined to abduct your friend by dragging her into Under The Skin-style pools of darkness, which Ico is forced to fight off often with only a stick (you can find a sword, but you\u2019re barely strong enough to swing it. You\u2019re just a child after all). That piece, and the skittering shuffle of \u2018Darkness\u2019 which accompanies those desperate moments, move with a calm terror, the musical equivalent of screaming in a nightmare to produce only silence.", "And yet they only make those moments of peace even more tender and special. If \u2018Darkness\u2019 has an opposite it\u2019s \u2018Heal\u2019, the wonderous, childlike lullaby that accompanies the precious moments of rest provided by stone seats (the game\u2019s save points). Some of Ico\u2019s most memorable moments come from loading the game later to find the pair sleeping to \u2018Heal\u2019 like Ingemar and Saga nestled on the couch in the end of My Life As A Dog. Ico reaches moments of grandeur such as the massively cathartic \u2018You Were There\u2019, which erupts in its heart wrenching finale, but it\u2019s Ico\u2018s smaller moments of gentle grace \u2013 and impending doom \u2013 that stick with us beyond anything else. Sometimes it\u2019s the little gestures that can feel like the biggest things in the world. Like these quietly powerful hymns, like holding someone\u2019s hand.", "Listen to the YouTube playlist here.", "100 Shovel Knight\n99 Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards\n98 Metal Gear Solid\u00a02 \u2013 Sons of Liberty\n97 Secret of Evermore\n96 McDonald\u2019s Treasure Land Adventure\n95 Ecco : The Tides Of Time\n94 Twinworld\n93 System Shock 2\n92 Machinarium\n91 Ikaruga\n90 Super Mario 64\n89 Dragon Quest VIII\n88 VVVVVV\n87 Psychonauts\n86 Megaman X\n85 Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney\n84 The Binding of Issac\n83 Police Quest 3\n82 Skies of Arcadia\n81 Altered Beast\n80 Bomberman Hero\n79 Kentucky Route Zero\n78 Panzer Dragoon\n77 Duck Tales\n76 Super Mario RPG\n75 The Curse of Monkey Island\n74 Time Crisis\n73 Oddworld: Abe\u2019s Odyssee\n72 Bastion\n71 Gitaroo Man\n70 Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon\n69 Crash Bandicoot\n68 The Neverhood\n67 Halo: Combat Evolved\n66 Out Run\n65 Ys I & II\n64 Battletoads\n63 Bubble Bobble\n62 Gone Home\n61 Golden Axe\n60 Dune II\n59 Star Fox\n58 Fez\n57 It Came From the Desert\n56 Legend of the Mystical Ninja\n55 The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past\n54 Doom\n53 Parasite Eve\n52 Kirby\u2019s Dream Land\n51 Parappa the Rapper\n50 Shadow Of The Colossus\n49 Ridge Racer 4\n48 FTL: Faster Than Light\n47 Alien Soldier\n46 Quake\n45 Fallout 3\n44 Silent Hill 2\n43 Grim Fandango\n42 Revenge of Shinobi\n41 Shadow of the Beast\n40 Mass Effect 2\n39 Chrono Cross\n38 F-Zero\n37 Star Control II\n36 Pokemon Red/Blue\n35 Ristar\n34 Street Fighter II\n33 NiGHTS into Dreams\u2026\n32 Half-Life 2\n31 Final Fantasy 7\n30 Tetris\n29 Goldeneye 007\n28 Rez\n24 Actraiser\n24 Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP\n24 Metroid\n24 Shenmue\n23 BioShock Infinite\n22 Castlevania: Symphony of the Night\n21 Clock Tower\n20 Sonic the Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles\n19 Super Mario Bros.\n18 Journey\n17 Jet Set Radio\n16 Final Fantasy 6\n15 Earthbound\n14 Secret of Mana\n13 Resident Evil 4\n12 Donkey Kong Country 2 : Diddy Kong\u2019s Quest\n11 The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time\n10 Red Dead Redemption\n9 Portal\n8 Streets Of Rage 2\n7 Katamari Damacy\n6 Silent Hill\n5 Super Metroid\n4 Megaman 2\n3 The Last Of Us\n2 Chrono Trigger\n1 Ico", "Read next: Listen to an exhilarating mix of the best ever Sonic The Hedgehog themes"]
